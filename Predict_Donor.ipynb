    "What is the problem that you’re solving? Who are you solving it for? \n",
    "* Reaching out to people asking for them to signup to become a donor or donate money is difficult. We have millions of potential clients but the majority of them refuse to donate money to charities. It becomes increasingly difficult and inefficient (cost wise and time wise) to reach out to every single person. In order to lower expenses and waste less time, there needs to be a method to reach out to high potential donors who are willing to donate. We can use machine learning to predict high potential individuals who are likely to respond/donate and give this model as a tool for organizations. Organizations who may find this helpful are nonprofits, charities, or hospitals."

    "What are potential features, whether already built or that you’ll need to make? What is your target variable? What transformations will you need to perform on your input data?\n",
    "* The dataset comes with about 50 features which may help. Some relevant features past money donations, response to surveys, donation amount, income, and donation frequency. We'll need to make a new feature column that is a boolean for whether someone has donated in 1997 (year of the data set). This feature column would be based off of column 'TARGET_D', which is the frequency of donations in the year of 1997. This and \"TARGET_D\" will be our targeted variables (if they donated in 1997 & how many times they've donated in 1997).    "
